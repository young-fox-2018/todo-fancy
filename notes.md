## .env
JWT_Secret=< secret to be used for JWT Token>

## Link Deploy
None Yet

## Additional Feature
*Not Sure if these are considered additonal features, but these are the items I spent quite some time on
1. Edit Task on "View Page" rather than using a modal or form
2. Animated border to show when the tasks are editable (toggled by clicking "Edit" button)

## Obstacles
1. Spent some time reworking on the models for projects and invitation, which took some time.

## Other Notes
Steps on Editing ToDo
1. Click on the <mark>Yellow</mark> Edit.
2. This should create a animated border, which indicate that the content is now editable.
3. Although the only focus that shows in on "Task Name", you can click the other area         ("Status", "Due", and "Description" ) to show the focus and edit it.
4. click the <span style="background-color: green">Green</span> Submit button to save the changes.
